;;;;;; TILE COLLISION FOR TOP DOWN GAMES: 

;;;; Before we update the position, though, if this is a scrolling game, we need to see if the player
;;;; is at the edge of the camera.  If he is at the edge of the camera, it
;;;; will do a bounds check.
	CheckPlayerCameraPosition
	   
;;;; if it turns out we were outside of the camera bounds, the macro
;;;; has RTSed out of this routine, so the hoziontal position will
;;;; never be updated.
 	;;;; this will check the top points for the sprite, not the collision points.
	;;;; It is used for checking "go behind" type tiles.
	CheckTopLayer
;;;;;   For top down type games, or games that generally have no gravity but have 4 directional movement,
;;;;;   we only need to check potential position and jump to the appropriate label.

CheckForCollision:

    ;;;; commonly, we won't want to waste cycling 6 times through this for each object when
    ;;;; all points are at no collision.  If by chance we NEED the zero type collision to do something, 
    ;;;; we can comment out the zero type check in this next line.  But most games are going to have
    ;;;; at least one "blank tile" that does nothing, and most games will use zero for this.
	
	;;;; Another conundrum is that a collision could take place in the current or new nametable.
	;;;; if this collision is of type that draws from screen data (for instance, NPC data or warp data), it could
	;;;; be problematic, as all variables handling these things are loaded with the current collision tables data.
	;;;; tempCol ends up being 0 or 1 based on which collision table this should be referencing.
